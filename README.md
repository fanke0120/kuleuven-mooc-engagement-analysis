# kuleuven-mooc-engagement-analysis

This repository contains the Python scripts and supplementary materials for the data analysis conducted in the Master's thesis: "**Data analysis and visualization on statistics of the European Studies MOOCs**".

The analysis pipeline is designed to process raw log data from three KU Leuven MOOCs on the edX platform, perform feature engineering, conduct K-Means clustering to identify learner profiles, and generate all visualizations presented in the results chapter.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following directories:

* **/analysis_codes**: Contains all Python scripts used for the analysis, from initial data processing to final visualization and statistical testing. It also includes information on the modifications made to the ELAT tool.

* **/data_files**: This directory is a placeholder. Due to data privacy and ethical restrictions, the raw and processed data files are not included in this public repository. See the Data Availability Statement below for more details.

* **/final_figures**: Contains all the final figures and charts generated by the analysis scripts, as they appear in the thesis.

## Data and Code Availability Statement

### Code Availability

This repository contains all Python scripts used for the data analysis and visualization generation for the Master's thesis mentioned above. The code is provided in a clean, well-commented format to ensure the full transparency and reproducibility of the research methods and analysis pipeline.

### Data Availability

The raw and pre-processed learner behavior data used in this study, including the CSV files generated by the ELAT tool, contain sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and are subject to relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) and the data use agreement under which they were obtained.

To protect the privacy of research participants and to adhere to academic ethical standards, these data files containing personal data are **not provided in this public repository**.

### Authorized Access to Data

* **For the Examination Committee and Supervisor:** The complete, non-anonymized dataset has been uploaded to a secure KU Leuven internal network drive. The access link has been provided separately through internal channels.

* **For Other Researchers:** Due to data privacy and ethical restrictions, the raw data cannot be shared publicly. Bona fide researchers may contact the author (ziyunn.ke@gmail.com) to discuss the possibility of data access in accordance with the data sharing agreement.
